# Stacks and Queues Data Structures
___

TRAVIS: https://travis-ci.org/Lennerblom/data-structures-and-algorithms

PR: https://github.com/Lennerblom/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/13

This module contains a Stack consturctor with a push() and pop() methods and a Queue constructor with an enqueue and dequeue methods.  In future versions of this module I will add a serialize() and deserialize() methods as well as tests.
